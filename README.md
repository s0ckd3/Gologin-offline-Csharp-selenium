Explanation of the Product class
TL;DR
The Product class is a C# class that represents a product. It has several properties and methods that are used to configure and spawn a browser instance.

## Explanation
The Product class is a C# class that represents a product. It has several properties and methods that are used to configure and spawn a browser instance. The class has the following properties:

- tmpdir: A string that represents the temporary directory to use for the browser instance.
- address: A string that represents the IP address to use for the browser instance.
- extra_params: An array of strings that represents any extra parameters to pass to the browser instance.
- port: An integer that represents the port to use for the browser instance.
- local: A boolean that indicates whether to use a local browser instance or a remote one.
- spawn_browser: A boolean that indicates whether to spawn a new browser instance or use an existing one.
- credentials_enable_service: A boolean that indicates whether to enable the credentials service.
- profile_id: A string that represents the profile ID to use for the browser instance.
- profile_path: A string that represents the path to the profile directory for the browser instance.
- executablePath: A string that represents the path to the browser executable.
- The Product class has the following methods:

1. Product(options): The constructor method that initializes the Product instance with the given options.
2. SetProfileId(profile_id): A method that sets the profile ID for the browser instance.
3. GetRandomPort(): A method that generates a random port number.
4. SpawnBrowser(Proxy): A method that spawns a new browser instance with the given proxy settings.
The Product class uses the OpenQA.Selenium and OpenQA.Selenium.Chrome namespaces to interact with the Chrome browser. The SpawnBrowser method uses the ChromeDriver class to spawn a new browser instance with the given settings. The method takes a Proxy parameter, which is a string that represents the proxy settings to use for the browser instance.

The SpawnBrowser method first generates a random port number and sets the port property to the generated port number. It then parses the Proxy parameter to extract the proxy host, port, username, and password. If the Proxy parameter is not valid, the method logs an error message and returns undefined.

The method then constructs an array of parameters to pass to the browser instance. The array includes the path to the browser executable, the remote debugging port, the user data directory, the password store type, and the language. If the Proxy parameter is valid, the method adds the proxy server and host resolver rules to the array of parameters.

Finally, the method uses the ChromeDriver class to spawn a new browser instance with the given parameters and returns the instance.

Possible bugs
If the executablePath property is not set to a valid path, the SpawnBrowser method will throw an error.
If the Proxy parameter is not in the correct format, the SpawnBrowser method will log an error message and return undefined.
If the extra_params property contains invalid parameters, the SpawnBrowser method may not work correctly.
Possible improvements
Add input validation to ensure that the Proxy parameter is in the correct format.
Add error handling to handle cases where the browser instance fails to spawn.
Add support for other browsers besides Chrome.
